# Colombian Payroll

This project was created to remember and implement basic aspects of a Colombian payroll.

You can review the requirements in [this file](https://github.com/dcarolinahdev/payroll_co_django/blob/main/requirements.txt).

The idea is to have a structure that facilitates the settlement of a Colombian payroll. The project will handle concepts such as:

- Employees (main data)
- Contracts (with their different types)
- Payrolls
